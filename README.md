Problem 1

Part1: (Exercise 2.11)(1.25‚Ä≤)

Using the direction.h interface [Figure 2-7 in textbook] as an example, design and implement a calendar.h interface that exports the Month type from Chapter 1, along with the functions daysInMonth and isLeapYear, which also appear in that chapter. Your interface should also export a monthTostring function that returns the constant name for a value of type Month. Test your implementation by writing a main program that asks the user to enter a year and then writes out the number of days in each month of that year, as in the following sample run:

Part2: (Exercise 6.5)(1.25‚Ä≤)

‚Ä¢ An overloaded version of the constructor that takes the first two parameters in the opposite order, for the benefit of clients in other parts of the world. This change allows the declaration of moontanding to be written as

‚Ä¢ The getter methods getDay, getMonth, and getYear.

Part3: (Exercise 6.6)(2.5‚Ä≤)

Extend the calendar.h interface still further by adding overloaded versions of the following operators:

‚Ä¢ The insertion operator &lt;&lt;.

‚Ä¢ The relational operators ==,! =,&lt;,&lt;=,&gt;, and &gt;=

‚Ä¢ The expression d1‚àí d2, which returns how many days separate d1 and d2 ‚Ä¢ The shorthand assignment operators + = and ‚àí = with an integer on the right

‚Ä¢ The ++ and ‚àí‚àí operators in both their prefix and suffix form.

Suppose, for example, that you have made the following definitions:

Requirments &amp; Hints:

For this problem, the three parts are combined together. The header file is in calendar.h; the source file is in calendar.cpp; the test part is in Assignment2.cpp. You need to finish all TODO parts in these files. The given output samples are shown in the comment of Assignment2.cpp.

Problem 2

(Exercise 5.13)(2.5‚Ä≤)

And the first one now

Will later be last

For the times they are a-changin‚Äô.

-Bob Dylan, ‚ÄùThe Times They Are a-Changin‚Äô,‚Äù 1963

Following the inspiration from Bob Dylan‚Äôs song (which is itself inspired by Matthew 19:30), write a function void reversequeue (Queue&lt;string&gt; &amp; queue);

that reverses the elements in the queue. Remember that you have no access to the internal representation of the queue and must therefore come up with an algorithm‚Äìpresumably involving other structures-that accomplishes the task.

Requirments &amp; Hints:

Please fill in the TODO part of reversequeue.h and reversequeue.cpp. The test part is located in Assignment2.cpp.

Problem 3

(Exercise 5.19)(2.5‚Ä≤)

Write a program that reads in lines from the user and translates each line either to or from Morse code depending on the first character of the line:

‚Ä¢ If the line starts with a letter, you want to translate it to Morse code. Any characters other than the 26 letters should simply be ignored.

‚Ä¢ If the line starts with a period (dot) or a hyphen (dash), it should be read as a series of Morse code characters that you need to translate back to letters. Each sequence of dots and dashes is separated by spaces, but any other characters should be ignored. Because there is no encoding for the space between words, the characters of the translated message will be run together when your program translates in this direction.

The program should end when the user enters a blank line. A sample run of this program (taken from the messages between the Titanic and the Carpathia in 1912) might look like this:

Requirments &amp; Hints:

A sample of creating morse code map is given in morsecode.cpp. You needn‚Äôt to implement it by yourself. For inverted map, it is not allowed to generate inverted map manually (typed inverted map directly). You need create the inverted map by using the created map before. Please fill in the TODO part of morsecode.h and morsecode.cpp. The test part is located in Assignment2.cpp.

Requirements for Assignment

We provided the header file calendar.h, reversequeue.h and morsecode.h; source file calendar.cpp, reversequeue.cpp and morsecode.cpp; the test file Assignment2.cpp. You need copy these files under the src folder in the Stanford Library and delete the existed hello.h and hello.cpp. Please rename the project name as your student ID. Then, you can write and debug your codes in all TODO parts.

Finally, please pack your whole project folder into a single .zip file, name it using your student ID (e.g. if your student ID is 123456, hereby the file should be named as 123456.zip ), and then submit the .zip file via BB system.
